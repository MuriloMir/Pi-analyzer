# Pi-analyzer
This software, written in Dlang, analyzes the digits of pi in order to find images and words in them.

It is just a funny experiment, it used a file with 1 billion digits of pi, it used an algorithm to turn the digits into images and then another algorithm to turn them into letters. The images unfortunately were all random, none of them formed a pattern, they were all similar to the image you can find in the "all results.zip" file.

The letters were counted to see how often each appeared, also the letters were examined to find words in them, each word was counted to see how often it appeared. Some letters barely appeared, some words also appeared rarely, whereas others appeared all the time.

All results can be found in the "all results.zip" file.
